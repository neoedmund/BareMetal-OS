Why another OS?

Well,

## source mature level (by neoe)
1. runnable, functional.(works)
2. readable (be understood easily)
3. changable (modify, bugfix easily)
4. reusable (used by other source easily)


for the reusable, let's compare Linux-like and BareMetal-like:

**Linux**:
You cannot just pull a module from Linux into your OS.

![module](https://github.com/neoedmund/BareMetal-OS/raw/master/www/modules.jpg "My dream")


**What I expected**:
People can make many linux clones instead of just many linux-distro.
